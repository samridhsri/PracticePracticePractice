# Why do we use Asymptotic Analysis?

To figure out which algorithm is better in terms of performance and speed.
It might be possible that one algorithm is better for some inputs while other is better for other inputs and vice versa.

#### Asymptotic Analysis is the big idea that handles above issues in analyzing algorithms

In Asymptotic Analysis, We evaluate the performance of an algorithm in terms of input size (we don't measure the actual running time).
We calculate, how the time (or space) taken by an algorithm increases with the input size.


# Worst, Average and Best Cases

### Big-O notation
We define an algorithm's worst-case time complexity by using the Big-O notation, which determines the set of function grows slower than or at the same rate as the expression.
Furthermore, it explains the maximum amount of time an algorithm requires considering all input values.
